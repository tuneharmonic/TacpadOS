# TacpadOS

**Helldivers and Helldivers 2 are developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Please support the official release.**
This is a fan project developed and distributed for free intended for personal use by the cosplay / enthusiast community.

Do you have a Helldivers cosplay you're working on, and a phone small enough to fit in the Tacpad, but really want to have an authentic-looking stratagem input on your screen instead of just your phone? Look no further, because TacpadOS has you covered! Currently only Android builds are configured as-is.

The app opens to a tactical clock screen, showing you the current Super Earth Standard Time (which is just local time, because Super Earth stands with you wherever you go, Helldiver).
Tapping the screen takes you to the Stratagem Input, where you can freely input any stratagem currently in the game, complete with code readout and sound effects.
From there, you can hit the "Lookup" button to have a handy reference of every stratagem your Super Destroyer has at the ready, and who knows? Maybe there's a way to get some stratagem training in too ;)

Sounds were sourced from reddit users ObieDobie and PowerPl4y3r and stratagem icons were sourced from the official Helldivers wiki.
